## 2026-06-25 - management-bootstrap

Commit: 593c405 (`docs: establish project management workflow`)

Objective:

Establish the project-management workflow before opening further hardware
implementation cycles.

Changed scope:

- Registered project-management documents in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added the current-cycle file.
- Added the cycle ledger.
- Added the committed report directory policy.

Verification:

- Documentation-only cycle.
- No simulation required.
- No board programming required.

Board action:

- Not run; this cycle does not change hardware behavior.

Evidence:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/current-cycle.md`
- `docs/cycle-log.md`
- `docs/reports/README.md`

Result:

- Project-management workflow is defined.

Residual risks:

- Existing source directories are still untracked because this cycle only
  established project-management documents.
